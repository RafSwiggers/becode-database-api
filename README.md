# BeCode Database API!

Ladies and gents, welcome to our latest little bit of growth. Today, we learn to build the backstage, the place behind the curtain. Today, we learn to make the magic happen!

## Summary
The goal of this exercise is to build the API and Database that would be behind a note-taking app. We're building a simple database and writing the PHP code that will manipulate that database, based on requests made by a user. It should react to GET and POST requests.

## Why?
As we progress, it's important to know what happens when we call an API. It's also important to be able to actually build an access point for other programs and websites. 

## How?
I used MAMP to create a local server, and to access and use the MYSQL.
